# Render Parity

P3 render parity compares three rendering paths:

- three-vrm reference render.
- Bevy adapter render.
- wgpu/custom-engine render.

Rendered artifacts remain under `.external-fixtures/render-parity/` and are not
committed. Each renderer should export a source-like RGBA JSON artifact:

```json
{
  "width": 2,
  "height": 1,
  "rgba": [255, 0, 0, 255, 0, 0, 255, 255]
}
```

The RGBA artifact is intentionally simple so browser canvas, Bevy readback,
wgpu readback, or an ash staging image can all write the same format before a
PNG visual artifact is added for human review.

## PSNR

Use the dependency-free comparator:

```powershell
node tools\render-parity\compare-psnr.mjs `
  --expected .external-fixtures\render-parity\three-vrm\Seed-san.frame000.rgba.json `
  --actual .external-fixtures\render-parity\wgpu\Seed-san.frame000.rgba.json `
  --out .external-fixtures\render-parity\reports\Seed-san.wgpu.frame000.psnr.json `
  --fail-under 40
```

The report contains dimensions, MSE, PSNR, maximum channel delta, maximum pixel
delta, and pass/fail status. Exact matches report `"Infinity"` for PSNR.

## three-vrm Capture

The first reference capture path is a browser script that renders a VRM through
the built three-vrm package and writes the same RGBA JSON format. It keeps
Playwright as an optional local tool rather than a repository dependency:

```powershell
npm install --no-save playwright
node tools\render-parity\three-vrm-browser-capture.mjs `
  --fixture .external-fixtures\official\Seed-san.vrm `
  --three-vrm-root D:\git\three-vrm `
  --out .external-fixtures\render-parity\three-vrm\Seed-san.frame000.rgba.json `
  --width 512 `
  --height 512
```

The script serves the local three-vrm build and fixture through a temporary
localhost server, opens Chromium, renders with a fixed camera/light setup, and
reads RGBA bytes from the WebGL drawing buffer. The Bevy capture path and deeper
wgpu material pass should match this camera/light setup before comparing PSNR.

For human review, also request a PNG:

```powershell
node tools\render-parity\three-vrm-browser-capture.mjs `
  --fixture .external-fixtures\official\Seed-san.vrm `
  --three-vrm-root D:\git\three-vrm `
  --out .external-fixtures\render-parity\three-vrm\Seed-san.frame000.rgba.json `
  --png-out .external-fixtures\render-parity\three-vrm\Seed-san.frame000.png `
  --width 512 `
  --height 512 `
  --camera-z 3.0
```

The local smoke run on 2026-05-29 captured Seed-san at `256x256`, wrote a PNG
for visual review, and self-compared the RGBA output with PSNR `Infinity`.

## Renderer Input Data

`vrm-io` now exposes renderer-facing glTF primitive data through
`LoadedVrm::meshes` and node-to-mesh references through `GltfNodeRest::mesh`.
Each `GltfPrimitiveData` stores material index, positions, normals,
`TEXCOORD_0`, and u32 indices. Bevy and wgpu capture paths should build their
mesh buffers from this data so they render the same primitives loaded from the
VRM file rather than using ad hoc sample geometry.

## wgpu Capture

The first Rust renderer path is `examples/wgpu_render_capture.rs`. It is an
offscreen wgpu example, not a new library dependency: it loads a VRM with
`vrm-io`, builds vertex/index buffers from `LoadedVrm::meshes`, renders with the
same fixed camera shape as the three-vrm capture, and writes both RGBA JSON and
an optional PNG:

```powershell
cargo run --example wgpu_render_capture -- `
  --fixture .external-fixtures\official\Seed-san.vrm `
  --out .external-fixtures\render-parity\wgpu\Seed-san.frame000.rgba.json `
  --png-out .external-fixtures\render-parity\wgpu\Seed-san.frame000.png `
  --width 256 `
  --height 256 `
  --camera-z 3.0
```

The local smoke run on 2026-05-29 successfully wrote wgpu RGBA/PNG artifacts
from the real Seed-san mesh primitives. The first PSNR against the three-vrm
reference is `8.78 dB`, which is intentionally recorded as a failing visual
parity baseline: the current path draws unskinned, untextured MToon base-color
geometry with a small diffuse shader. Next parity work should add texture
sampling, alpha/cull parity, skinning or rest-pose parity policy, and fuller
MToon lighting before tightening thresholds.

## Review Criteria

Initial thresholds are intentionally conservative until real renderer captures
are stable:

- Static pose, unlit or neutral-light setup: PSNR >= 45 dB.
- MToon lit material render with antialiasing disabled: PSNR >= 40 dB.
- Spring/VRMA animated frame with deterministic camera and fixed timestep:
  PSNR >= 38 dB.

Any failure should store the expected, actual, difference/heatmap image if
available, and the PSNR report under `.external-fixtures/render-parity/reports/`.
Human visual review should compare the rendered PNGs alongside the numeric
report before declaring parity.

## Next Renderer Work

- Add a Bevy capture path that renders the same camera/light/material setup and
  writes RGBA JSON after readback using `LoadedVrm::meshes`.
- Deepen the wgpu capture path with texture sampling, MToon material state,
  alpha/cull parity, and animation/skinning policy before raising PSNR
  thresholds.
